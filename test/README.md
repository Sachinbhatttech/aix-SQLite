# SQLiteTest

This is a very simple App Inventor program I use to test some of the features of the SQLite extension.
It should work in all the other flavors of the App Inventor platform.

## Resources

The "exec.sql", "monthNames.txt", and "insert.csv" files should be added to the application as media assets.
The program uses them for some of the tests.
